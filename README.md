# Performance Evaluation of Several Classification Algorithms for Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the breast. While most lumps are benign (non-cancerous), certain benign lumps can increase the risk of developing breast cancer. In this project, we analyze the Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset from scikit-learn, which contains 569 instances of tumor data collected by the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The project evaluates the performance of four classification algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to predict the malignancy of tumors based on features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to:
- Experiment with multiple classification models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.
- Preprocess and analyze the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Train and evaluate models, comparing their accuracy and performance in classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Python:** Programming language for data science and machine learning.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning library for implementing algorithms and evaluating models.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computations and array operations.
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization library for creating static plots.
- **Seaborn:** Built on matplotlib, for enhanced data visualizations and statistical graphics.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset** from scikit-learn, which includes 569 instances with 30 features describing the properties of cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies. The dataset is split into two classes:
- Malignant (1)
- Benign (0)

## Results and Conclusion

The accuracy of the four classification models tested is as follows:

- **Decision Tree:** 94.74%
- **Random Forest:** 96.49%
- **Logistic Regression:** 95.61%
- **Naive Bayes:** 97.37%

Based on the evaluation metrics, Naive Bayes is the most effective model for classifying the breast cancer dataset, as it achieved the highest accuracy.
